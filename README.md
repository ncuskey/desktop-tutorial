# MapEngine Web App

This project uses React and TypeScript to render and manipulate fantasy maps in the browser. A WebWorker (`src/worker.ts`) performs heavy map generation tasks so the UI stays responsive.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start          # launches the development server
npm test           # runs unit tests
